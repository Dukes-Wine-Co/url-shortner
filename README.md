# Url Shortner

## Summary
This application is a URL shortner akin to [bit.ly](bit.ly) that enables the server to route requests to the shortened url through to the destination page. Think [dukes.wine/us](https://dukes.wine/us) &rarr; [dukeswines.com/about](https://dukeswines.com/about).

We're primarily leveraging this application to facilitate the use of concise, human-readable urls in  social media postings. Secondarily, we're using this application as a gateway to measure inbound traffic to our website.

Feel free to reach out to us at [engineering@dukeswines.com](mailto:engineering@dukeswines.com) if you have any questions or suggestions.
