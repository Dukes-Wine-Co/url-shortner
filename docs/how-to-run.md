## How to run
Before running this application, you'll need to make sure that you have a properly configured environment that
 exposes a redirect base route (ex. https://dukeswines.com) as well as a mongo url for a user with write access (ex
 : mongodb://myDBReader:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@mongodb0.example.com:27017/admin). To help along with this task, there is a
  setup script that you can execute by running ```npm run setup```.

### Run in Production Mode
```source env.sh; npm start```

### Run in Development Mode
```npm run dev```
